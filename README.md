## General Information

### Project Information

> The project is an Assignment to create a Multiple Linear Regression model using the BoomBikes dataset to predict the demand for shared bikes.

### Project Background
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

Essentially, the company wants â€”

Understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.
They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

### Project Statement
Create a model to predict the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions

- Year 2019 has higher rentals than 2018.
- Rentals a less in months of Dec, Jan and Feb due to (probably) environmental conditions.
- A user is more likely to rent a bike when the weather is "clear" and less likely to
rent it when it snows.
- Fall season has the highest number of bike rentals followed by summer, and, in
each season the booking count has increased from 2018 to 2019.
- When it's a holiday, bookings seem to be less in number.
